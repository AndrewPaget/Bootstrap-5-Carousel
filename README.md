Bootstrap 5 Carousel

A bootstrap carousel the advances one element at a time. In this use case a total of seven cards with four showing at any one time. It's responsive and stacks to a single column below 768px.

This page is a (simplified) template Bootstrap 5 Carousel (5 NOT 4 or 3...plenty of these already ourt there) users looking at integrating a carousel with multiple elements (cards, images etc).

Bootstrap 5 by default comes with no jquery so this template makes use of pure javascript to make the advance (currently heading left).

The carousel auto starts and has the bare minimum to get it going.

I created this because I could not find one anywhere on the net that could handle multiple elements per slide and advance one element at a time...using only plain javascript and maybe because Bootstrap 5 is really quite new.

For my specific requirements (simple) it worked great. Maybe it can start someone else of for a more elaborate version. Go both directions and include left and right buttons etc.

Use it if you like. Have fun.
